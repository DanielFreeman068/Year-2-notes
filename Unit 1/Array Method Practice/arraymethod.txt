We use Arrays because they are required and pivotal in every website, database, web applications...etc
For our immediate use Arrays are required to easily populate websiteis

TERNARIES - {conditional ? truePath : falsePath}

SPREAD OPERATOR - ... will iterate through and add all values from an array-like object and "spread" it into the new object
book = {
    title: 'coding',
    pages: 123
}
bookv2 = {
    ...book,
    pages: 140
}
MAPPING ARRAYS - When you have an array with several items that you want to break down the best way is .map()
 - .map() is an array method that will go through each of the items and do a thing
 - .map() returns a whole new array when finished
 - other methods such as forEach() do not create new arrays and instad just paste content for the existing array
ANATOMY OF .Map() - let newArray - people.map((person) => {
    the first part of a map method is a variable name that will represent each item from your array
 - this variable name should be named as the singular or the array
    people => person
    books => book
 - next you can destructure your item if you like, this is not required but does make the setup easier
 - let newArray - people.map((person) => {
    const {name, age, job, shirtColor, drink, pet} = person;
 - lastly you need to return the object back from the map. without the return statement it will do nothing and error
  - return {...person, shirtColor: 'tie-dye', isNice: 'yes'};
.forEach()
 - forEach doesn't return an array as an output
 - you have three values that you can use to work with: Value, Index, Array(the entire thing)
 - the last export of a forEach loop is 'undefined' this really messed with returning values
 - instead you can have a conditional that acts depending on the values returned
    counting occurences
    breaking up the array into smaller arrays
    printing out every name that starts with A
 - in other words if the loop runs into an undefined item you have those three options as example or whatever else you want to deal with it

 Filter() - filter is how you can remove certain items from your array. it will go through each item and compare them to the conditional that you set up, true gets added false does not
 - it does not alter the array
